# Changepoint Detection in RedCarpet Genome

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script for detecting changepoints in the RedCarpet genome dataset. The script uses the `ruptures` library for efficient changepoint detection and is optimized for performance with parallel processing capabilities.

## Features
- **Changepoint Detection**: Utilizes the `ruptures` library to identify significant changes in the dataset.
- **Parallel Processing**: Leverages multiprocessing for faster analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes functionality to visualize changepoints on a heatmap.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Ruptures

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy ruptures
```

### Download
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/redcarpet-changepoint-detection.git
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your data is in a compatible format (currently supports `.txt` files with tab-separated values).

2. **Run the Script**: Execute the main script to perform changepoint detection:

    ```bash
    python change_point_detection.py
    ```

3. **View Results**: The script will output a heatmap visualization of the changepoints and a text file listing all detected changepoints.
